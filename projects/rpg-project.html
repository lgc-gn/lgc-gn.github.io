                The Untitled RPG Game was a game project I lead during my junior year for a game development course. Inspired by games such as <i>Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions</i>
                and <i>Baldur's Gate</i>, my group and I decided to make a turn based combat game with chess-like movement, and custom classes inspired by the <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> universe.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the span of 10 weeks we developed:<ol>A tile-based movement/combat system</ol>
                    <ol>Simple enemy AI for the player to defeat</ol>
                    <ol>Custom user interface to allow player control and provide information</ol>
                    <ol>Animation blending and event triggered effects</ol>
                    <ol>Class skills that match their themes</ol>
            </p1>
            <br>
            We used Trello to manage and delegate tasks to group members, which can be found<a class="center" href="https://trello.com/b/DQAvoe5C/cs410-project" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>

            <ol> Tools used:
                <li>Unity</li>
                <li>C#</li>
